Go to the admin control panel, click 'Languages' and 'Import/Export'. Click on the 'Import' tab. Select the fusion.support-center.language.xml file from your computer, and enable 'Bypass version check'. Click 'Import', and Kayako will import the new support center language pack, which will be available to your customers in the support center.
